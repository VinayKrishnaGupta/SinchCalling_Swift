# SinchCalling_Swift
SincCalling_Swift is a sample application for app to app calling using Sinch framework (https://www.sinch.com/). This application is similar to the application you get while you download Sinch SDK from official website, but this is written in Swift.

Steps to Run this app:

1) Register yourself at Sinch.

2) Register your app in Sinch, you'll get the Application Key and Secret.

3) Paste the Application Key & Secret in initSinchClientWithUserId method of AppDelegate.

4) That's it Go Ahead & Run.


To Update Sinch SDK in future :

As Sinch SDK is installed as CocoaPod, all we need to do to is run pod update for the project.
